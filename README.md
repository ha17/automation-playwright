# automation-playwright

## What this is
Some sample automation scripts, written in Python, for the Playwright browser automation system

## What this isn't
Something you should use unethically or immorally. I wanted a real-world example of how you can indentify items on a page, get their value, take a screenshot of them, and automate finding information you would normally need to find manually.

## What you need
* To set up [Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up) on your system
* To set up [Playwright](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/playwright/) on your system (here's the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright), if you use Docker)
* To understand how to run a [Python script](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/how-to-run/) on your system
