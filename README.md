# automation-playwright

## What this is
Some sample automation scripts, written in Python, for the Playwright browser automation system

## What this isn't
Something you should use unethically or immorally. I wanted a real-world example of how you can indentify items on a page, get their value, take a screenshot of them, and automate finding information you would normally need to find manually.

## What you need
* To set up Python on your system
* To set up Playwright on your system
* To understand how to run a Python script on your system
